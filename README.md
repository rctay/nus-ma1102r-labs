Description
===========

The lab sessions are heavily oriented to Maple, a proprietary product.
What's a cool FOSS dude to do? Use
[Maxima](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/) and
[Octave](www.gnu.org/software/octave/)!

Maxima's syntax is very close to Maple; have a look at this
[comparison table](http://beige.ucs.indiana.edu/P573/node35.html).
Octave's is more C-like, and it's a little easier to write long,
complicated functions.
